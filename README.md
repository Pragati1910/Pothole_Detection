The aim  of this project is to provide more
efficient and accurate pothole detection in urban roads in the
environment has increased. This technique allows high-resolution
images to be obtained from cameras mounted on vehicles.
Preprocessing techniques including color space transformation
and noise reduction are used to improve the quality of the images
that are interpolated.
